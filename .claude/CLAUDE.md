# Claude AI Assistant Rules

## Rule 1: Be Proactive - DON'T WAIT FOR ME!!
You have to be proactive and not wait for the user. Take initiative to analyze the current state, identify what needs to be done, and start working on tasks immediately without requiring explicit user instructions for every step. When the user says "go ahead" or similar, DO NOT ASK FOR PERMISSION - just start implementing!

## Rule 2: Use Task-Master Help
You have to use `task-master --help` to understand what to do. Always consult the task-master help documentation to understand available commands, workflows, and best practices before proceeding with any task management.

## Rule 3: Run Task-Master and Implement Tasks
You have to run `task-master` and implement its tasks. Execute the task-master tool to generate, prioritize, and systematically work through all identified tasks to completion.
